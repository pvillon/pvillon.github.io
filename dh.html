  <p>The digital humanities is a field changing the way we approach the production, preservation, and distribution of information and knowledge. For a traditional definition of the digital humanities, I am drawn to the one provided by Burdick et al. in their 2012 book, <i>Digital_Humanities</i>: “The digital humanities generates a praxis defined by the intermeshing of ideology and computational methods working to redraw the boundaries between the humanities, the social sciences, the arts, and the natural sciences to foster a new tradition.”</p>

  <p>This project continues ongoing conversations about recontextualizing and expanding our understanding of how we engage with film using avant-garde and experimental works originating as celluloid media ascase studies. Digitization of celluloid media provides greater points of access to works on analog formatsyet should not be considered a means to an end as there is more to explore within this relationship. Using the computational tools FFmpeg, Image Macroanalysis in JavaScript, and ImagePlot for ImageJ, we canapproach a different visual understanding of cinema that allows us to challenge the traditional concept oftime and its relation to film. Can we encounter new meanings from moving image works when we view theframes concurrently? How do digital humanities applications contribute to an alternative method of engage-ment with moving images? Are the resulting revisualizations an alternative form of film analysis, and thus, a form of cinematic consciousness?</p>

  <p>Originally created as my final project in Digital Humanities 201: Introduction to Digital Humanities with Professor Miriam Posner, this project has since been expanded into manuscript format, where it was published in a special edition of the journal <i>Cinergie</i> titled "Film Heritage and Digital Scholarship - Computer Based Approaches to Film Archiving, Restoration and Philology" edited by Rossella Catanese, Adelheid Heftberger, and Christian Gosvig Olesen.</p>

  <p>A general lesson in emulation for digital media archivists&mdash;especially for those with little to no experience, have no idea what emulation is, or want to learn more about how emulation can be used for archival workflows.

  <p>Data sits in silos between numerous organizations distributing independent and artist-made works. While the many  organizations distribute the works of numerous overlapping filmmakers and titles, some organizations may have titles by particular artists other organizations may not have, leading to increased search time for users or even missed opportunities for access. This outlined strategy proposes a high-level plan for aggregating distributor information on Wikibase by using the organizations Arsenal, Light Cone, and Video Data Bank as case studies. Standards utilized include PBCore controlled vocabularies, JSON-Linked Data (LD), and Wikidata QIDs. Created in Information Studies 461: Metadata taught by Melissa Gill.</p>

  <h1>Data Visualization at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films</h1>

  <p>In Fall 2021, my friend and colleague <a href="https://russellzych.github.io/" target="_blank">Russell Zych<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a> and I interned at the <a href="https://aficatalog.afi.com/" target="_blank">AFI Catalog of Feature Films<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a>. The project gave me the opportunity to put into practice more hands-on approaches to data cleaning and visualization utilizing the data forming the foundation of the catalog. The AFI Catalog is an ongoing project by the <a href="https://afi.com/" target="_blank">American Film Institute (AFI)<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a> to catalog all commercially-made and theatrically exhibited American motion pictures from the birth of cinema in the late 1890s to the present. Works within the catalog include a film's title, production and distrubtion companies, production and release dates, cast, and plot summaries, in addition to other snippets of information. We cleaned the catalog data using OpenRefine and visualized the data using Tableau. <b>Note</b>: Due to company policy, the data visualizations from the full project cannot be publicly shared. The image here is included as a brief sample of our work.</p>

  <p>Other film and media studies scholarship intersecting with the digital humanities inspired our work, notably the <a href="https://projectarclight.org/book/" target="_blank">Arclight Guidebook to Media History and the Digital Humanities<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a> published in 2016 edited by Eric Hoyt and Charles R. Acland. We also compiled a bibliography of relevant sources for our work as part of our final in Information Studies 498: Internship with Dee Winn, which can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HNOhBEqX2-5vAbEObrgZfWMP916G6zDWKfY2NFF9kY8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>

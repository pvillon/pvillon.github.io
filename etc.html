  <p>This project continues ongoing conversations about recontextualizing and expanding our understanding of how we engage with film using avant-garde and experimental works originating as celluloid media as case studies. Digitization of celluloid media provides greater points of access to works on analog formats yet should not be considered a means to an end as there is more to explore within this relationship. 
  <br>
  <br>
  What can we understand from moving image works when we view the disparate frames forming the foundation of these works concurrently? What new meanings can we discern from this form of engagement with moving images? Are the resulting revisualizations an alternative form of film analysis, and thus, a form of cinematic consciousness?</p>

  <p>A general lesson in emulation for digital media archivists&mdash;especially for those with little to no experience, have no idea what emulation is, or want to learn more about how emulation can be used for archival workflows.

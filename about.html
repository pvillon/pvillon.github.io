<p><b>Patricia Ledesma Villon</b> is a curator, moving image archivist, and researcher based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She is Assistant Curator of Moving Image at the <a href="https://walkerart.org/" target="_blank">Walker Art Center<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a>.
  
<p>Her interdisciplinary work focuses on the intersections of collections and public curation, film and media archives, artist-made films and exhibition, photochemical filmmaking and preservation, and the history and contemporary use of moving image technology. As an archivist, she has processed audiovisual collections and worked on related initiatives for the Prelinger Archives, the Center for Asian American Media’s “Memories to Light” home movie project, filmmaker and scholar Trinh T. Minh-ha, and the Philippine Film Archive. 
  
<p>Born and raised in the southeastern San Francisco Bay Area, Patricia holds an MLIS with a specialization in Media Archival Studies from UCLA and a B.A. in Media Studies from UC Berkeley. Since 2019, she has been a member and co-organizer of <a href=http://www.lightfieldfilm.org/ target="_blank">Light Field<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a>, a collectively-run exhibition of recent and historical moving image art on film in the Bay Area. She serves on the Board of Directors of <a href="https://canyoncinema.com/" target="_blank">Canyon Cinema<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a> and the advisory editorial board of <a href="https://www.artifactapparatus.com/journal/" target="_blank"><i>Artifact & Apparatus</i><span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a>.

<p>She enjoys all sorts of Asian cuisines, a local dive and supper club, searching for and fixing up vintage 48cm chromoly bikes, tinkering with various media objects, and being outdoors. Recommendations always welcome.

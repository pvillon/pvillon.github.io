Since 2019, she has been a member and co-organizer of <a href=http://www.lightfieldfilm.org/ target="_blank">Light Field<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a>, a collectively-run exhibition of recent and historical moving image art on film in the San Francisco Bay Area, where she was born and raised. She serves on the Board of Directors of <a href="https://canyoncinema.com/" target="_blank">Canyon Cinema<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a> and the advisory editorial board of <a href="https://www.artifactapparatus.com/journal/" target="_blank"><i>Artifact & Apparatus</i><span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a>.

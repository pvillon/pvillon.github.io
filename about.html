<p><b>Patricia Ledesma Villon</b> is a moving image archivist, curator, and researcher from the southeastern San Francisco Bay Area. She has processed audiovisual collections and worked on archival initiatives for the Prelinger Archives, the Center for Asian American Media’s “Memories to Light” home movie project, filmmaker and scholar Trinh T. Minh-ha, and the Philippine Film Archive. Her archival practices focus on the intersections of photochemical filmmaking and preservation, theories of audiovisual archiving, digital preservation, artist-made cinema and exhibition, and the history of moving image technology.

<p>She received a B.A. in Media Studies from UC Berkeley and is a graduate of UCLA’s MLIS program with a specialization in Media Archival Studies, where she <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6ns501xm" target="_blank">conducted research<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a> on the role of commercial, archival, and artist-run film laboratories in the moving image archiving and preservation field. Patricia is also a member and co-organizer of <a href=http://www.lightfieldfilm.org/ target="_blank">Light Field<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a>, an annual exhibition of recent and historical moving image art on film, and an at-large member of the artist-run Black Hole Collective Film Lab in Oakland, California. 

<p>Currently based in Minneapolis, she serves on the Board of Directors of <a href="https://canyoncinema.com/" target="_blank">Canyon Cinema<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a> and is the Bentson Archivist and Assistant Curator of the Moving Image department of the <a href="https://walkerart.org/" target="_blank">Walker Art Center<span class="screen-reader-only">(opens in a new tab)</span></a>, where she oversees the preservation of the Ruben/Bentson Moving Image Collection.
